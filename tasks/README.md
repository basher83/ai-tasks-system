# Generic Task Management System Template

## Overview

This is a reusable task management system template designed for any software project. It provides structured tracking for work items, dependencies, and progress across development phases. The system is technology-agnostic and can be adapted to any tech stack or project type.

## Purpose

The task system addresses several critical needs:

- **Visibility**: Clear understanding of what needs to be done and current progress
- **Dependencies**: Explicit tracking of task relationships and blockers
- **Prioritization**: P0/P1/P2 classification for resource allocation
- **Validation**: Success criteria and validation steps for each task
- **Documentation**: Detailed implementation guidance for complex tasks
- **Adaptability**: Customizable categories and validation patterns for any project type

## How to Use This Template

### 1. Copy to Your Project

```bash
# Copy the template directory to your project
cp -r ./ tasks/

# Navigate to your tasks directory
cd tasks/
```

### 2. Customize Categories

Edit `INDEX.md` to define your project-specific task categories:

```text
# Example Categories:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development/               # DEV tasks (setup, tooling, dependencies)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/                  # FEAT tasks (new features, functionality)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bugs/                      # BUG tasks (bug fixes, issue resolution)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation/             # DOCS tasks (guides, documentation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testing/                   # TEST tasks (tests, validation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance/               # PERF tasks (optimizations)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security/                  # SEC tasks (security improvements)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ refactoring/               # REFACTOR tasks (code improvements)
```

### 3. Define Task ID Prefixes

Choose 3-4 letter prefixes for your task categories:

- **DEV** - Development setup, tooling, dependencies
- **FEAT** - New features and functionality
- **BUG** - Bug fixes and issue resolution
- **DOCS** - Documentation and guides
- **TEST** - Testing implementation and coverage
- **PERF** - Performance optimizations
- **SEC** - Security improvements
- **REFACTOR** - Code refactoring and improvements

### 4. Customize Validation Commands

Edit `template.md` to include project-specific validation commands:

```bash
# Example validation patterns (customize for your tech stack)
# For web apps: npm run build, npm run test, npm run lint
# For databases: dbt build, sqlfluff lint
# For IaC: terraform validate, packer validate
# For containers: docker build, docker-compose up
```

## Directory Structure

```text
tasks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # Project-specific documentation (adapt this template)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ INDEX.md                    # Active task tracker and progress dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template.md                 # Task file template (customize for your tech stack)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [category-1]/               # Your first task category directory
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [PREFIX]-XXX-*.md       # Task files using your prefixes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [category-2]/               # Your second task category directory
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [PREFIX]-XXX-*.md       # Task files using your prefixes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [category-n]/               # Additional task categories as needed
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [PREFIX]-XXX-*.md       # Task files using your prefixes
```

## How to Use This System

- FEAT-001, FEAT-002, etc.
- BUG-001, BUG-002, etc.

### 3. Use the Template

Copy `template.md` and fill in all sections:

- Keep descriptions concise and actionable
- Include specific commands and file paths for your tech stack
- Define clear success criteria
- **IMPORTANT**: Run `date +"%Y-%m-%d"` to get current date for Created/Updated fields
- Update the "Updated" field whenever status changes
- Customize validation commands for your specific tools and frameworks

### 4. Update INDEX.md

Add your task to the appropriate phase table and update:

- Task counts and time estimates
- Dependency graph if needed
- Overall completion percentage
- Project-specific phases and timelines

## Best Practices

### Task Sizing

- **Small** (1-2 hours): Single file changes, simple configurations
- **Medium** (3-4 hours): Multi-file changes, new features
- **Large** (5+ hours): Consider breaking into subtasks

### Dependencies

- List explicit task IDs that must complete first
- Use "None" for tasks that can start immediately
- Update blocked tasks when dependencies complete

### Validation

- Include specific commands to verify success for your tech stack
- Reference test files or build scripts
- Document expected output
- Customize validation for your specific tools (npm, yarn, docker, terraform, etc.)

### Documentation

- Link to relevant project documentation
- Reference external resources specific to your tech stack
- Include troubleshooting tips for your tools

## Example Implementation

See [`tasks/`](tasks/) for a complete working example of the task management system in action. This includes:

- **6 example tasks** across 3 categories (DEV, FEAT, TEST)
- **Real implementation steps** with actual commands
- **Dependency management** showing how tasks block each other
- **Complete workflow** from setup to testing

### Quick Start with Example

```bash
# 1. Explore the example tasks
cat tasks/INDEX.md | head -20
cat tasks/development/DEV-001-*.md

# 2. See the dependency graph
cat tasks/INDEX.md | grep -A 10 "Task Dependencies"

# 3. Try validation commands from the tasks
cd tasks
npm run build    # Example command from DEV-003
npm test         # Example command from TEST-001
```

The example demonstrates a complete project workflow from development setup through feature implementation to testing.
